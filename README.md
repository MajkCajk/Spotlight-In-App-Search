# Spotlight-In-App-Search

Example of an App that index data to Spotlight and then let you search them thru in app search bar.

## About
There is a way that your apps content could show up in a spotlight search. You can index it in your app and put it to the spotlight framework.
I found a lot of tutorials and ways how to do it ([Ray Wenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com/1544-ios-9-app-search-tutorial-introduction-to-app-search)) but I didn't found much about the other way around. Use these indexes and ios spotlight search inside my app for searching content from the app.

I did it and this is sample app that shows how to do it.
BUT it has its cons and pros.
